## frontend-mentor-nft-card-second-attempt

Second attempt at the NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor.

This solution is a more polished version of the previous one. This version also relies heavily on flexbox to center the card on the page, and for the layout of the card.

The main difference between this attempt and the first one is that this one uses positioned elements along with z-index to create the cyan hue on the image when hovering over it, whereas the previous project used inset box shadows.

A padding is now used inside the card, which is a much simpler way of creating that space between the content and the edge of the card compared to the previous attempt where I used margins on every single element inside the card, which made it much more tedious to work with the layout.

Another thing to note is that the border radius and box shadow on the card are closer to the design mockups for both the mobile and desktop versions.
